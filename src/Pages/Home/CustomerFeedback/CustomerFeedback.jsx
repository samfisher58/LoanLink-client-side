			'LoanLink has completely transformed how I manage loans for my customers. Before, everything was on paper and Excel sheets — it was chaotic and error-prone. Now, applications come in digitally, verification is faster, and EMI reminders ensure timely repayments. My recovery rate has improved by over 30%! Highly recommended for any microfinance group.',

			"I was skeptical at first about moving to a web-based system, but LoanLink made the transition seamless. The dashboard gives me a clear overview of all active loans, pending reviews, and repayments. Disbursements are now direct to mobile money — no more cash handling risks. It's reliable, easy to use, and has made our operations much more professional.",
